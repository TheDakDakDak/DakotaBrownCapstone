		<h2>The Enhanced Application</h2>
		<p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/TheDakDakDak/DakotaBrownCapstone/tree/main/Enhanced%20Weight%20Tracker%20App" target="_blank">full enhanced project</a> on GitHub. It contains all of the necessary files to run it yourself on AndroidStudio.</p>
		<h3>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h3>
		<p>The purpose of <a href="../images/weightlist.png" target="_blank">this</a> enhancement was to bring a little bit more life to the main weights page, as well as provide a bit more useful information to the user. The original artifact showed only the user's weight entry as well as the date that it was entered. With this enhanced version, it also includes the change in weight since the last entry, as well as the number of pounds away the user still is from their goal weight. This was accomplished by adding two extra columns to the activity's xml file and then calculating and adding the values in each entry in GridActivity's loadWeightEntries method, which is assisted by databasehelper.</p>
		<h3>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
		<p><a href="../images/weightlosscalculator.png" target="_blank">This</a> was my personal favorite enhancement as it added a lot of value by adding a brand new, and useful bit of functionality to the app. The Weight Loss Calculator. It asks the user for several pieces of information such as their weight, height, gender, age, and activity level, and implements the Mifflin-St. Jeor formula to calculate their total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). Their TDEE is the total number of calories they burn per day. The user also enters how much weight they'd like to lose and how fast they'd like to lose the weight, and then this new calculation takes into account their TDEE and informs them of the maximum calories they can eat each day if they'd like to lose the given weight in the given amount of time. The algorithm also notifies them if their weight loss goal is too ambitious to the point of being unsafe. For this enhancement, the calculator had only standalone functionality and did not interact with the database at all as it relied only on the user's input. This was changed slightly in Enhancement 3. </p>
		<h3>Enhancement 3: Databases</h3>
		<p>This enhancement builds upon the last one in that it adds functionality to the weight loss calculator. First, I set up an activity for the user to update their <a href="../images/updateprofile.png" target="_blank">user profile</a>. This involved adding a few things to the database: the user's preferred name, their height, age, and gender. Once entered, they're stored in a new table for use in the weight loss calculator. Then when the user clicks on the Weight Loss Calculator, these pieces of information that they added to their profile are pulled from the database and <a href="../images/prepopulatedwlc.png" target="_blank">prepopulated</a> into their corresponding fields so that the user doesn't need to enter them. It also pulls their most current weight entry (which we already had in the database prior to this enhancement) to populate that field. The fields are still however editable in case the user wants to enter the information for someone else, or just wants to play around with the calculator. </p>

		<h2>Enhancement Narratives</h2>
		<p>For each of these enhancements, they are based off of the final project for the Mobile Architecture and Development class that I took at SNHU which was completed in February of this year (2024). It's a weight tracker application that first prompts the user to login, and if they don't already have an acccount, they must create one. Once logged in, it displays a screen of all the weights that they've entered next to the date. The user can of course add new weights to the list or delete them if they'd like to start over. It also allows them to add a goal weight which is stored in the database and once that goal weight is met, code is in place to send them a congratulatory text message, although this utility was not functional in this original project.</p>
		<p>One of the reasons I chose this specific artifact is because I no longer have a good portion of my old work from SNHU. But the primary reason I chose this one for all three is because it has a nice level of complexity and utility, so there are really a lot of opportunities for enhancing it even further. It's a strong enough original piece that I still have the option to improve upon it further even after the completion of this capstone project. The opportunities to grow in knowledge using this piece of software as a base or a launch pad are pretty much endless.
		
		<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
		<p>This is a solid piece of software that actually has real-life use cases, much like software I’d be working on in the workforce, so regarding the software engineering aspect of it, this artifact is very ideal. Creating this application from scratch and then incrementally enhancing it is the very definition of software engineering. Regarding specifically this enhancement, it involved taking an already functional piece of software and modifying it's underlying code as well as it's layout and database helper functions to meet the goal of producing greater value for the end user. To do this while maintaining the functionality of all of it's previous utility and not breaking anything is what software engineering is all about. I discussed this in the corresponding section in more detail above, but this enhancement added two columns to the weight list that displays to the user the change (in pounds) from the last entry as well as how many pounds they still need to lose to reach their goal weight.</p>
		<p>The most important takeaway from making this enhancement was the importance of small, iterative development as when I tried to bite off too much at the same time with a change without testing it, I kept breaking the application. Testing early and testing often in the process really helped me out. I ran into a roadblock where after adding a query to the database to store the goal weight in a variable, the program would crash. I wasn't exactly sure where the problem was coming from, so I went into the Databasehelper class and included lines to debug/test the program to find where the lines of code became unreachable. After figuring that out, I added more sophisticated error handling with a try/catch block and the issue resolved. The problem was with database management, but was no match for a simple debugging method. This sort of testing was curcial to my ability to solve the problem. My ability to work with increasingly complex user interfaces also improved as adding even more moving parts to an already busy user dashboard was a bit challenging, but I'm definitely happy with the end result.</p>
		
		<h3>Enhancement 2</h3>
		<p>Due to the open-ended nature of an application like this, it's a prime candidate for brand new activities/additions. And what better a place to implement a new algorithm than a brand new, fresh utility. That's where the weight loss calculator came in. Admittedly, the creation of most calculator utilities doesn't involve the most complex algorithim in the world. However, taking the user's input and using it to implement the Mifflin-St. Jeor formula, then piggybacking off of that transformed data to make another calculation of total number of calories the user may eat, all the while maintaining an intuitive user interface and displaying the refined data to the user in a useful, easy-to-digest format, was a valuable learning experience for me. I discussed this in the corresponding section in more detail above, but this enhancement took input from the user about their height, weight, gender, activity level, and also asks them how much weight they'd like to lose and how quickly. This is all run through the algorithm and produces a single value (the max number of calories the user may eat each day to lose their specified weight in the specified amount of time) and displays this to the user in an easy-to-understand format. Notably, this is the only enhancement of the three that is standalone and does not rely on the database.</p>
		<p>In this project, I furthered my understanding and skills in taking a problem and compartmentalizing it into smaller, more easily manageable chunks. It’s easy to get caught up in the project and doing too much at once, but that very often leads to broken code without a readily clear reason why it’s not functioning correctly. Doing things in small steps at a time and testing often resolves this problem almost completely. I also gained skill in optimizing code because at first I was taking the EditText object value, storing that in a string variable, and then in another variable parsing that string into a double or an int which just created too many unnecessary variables. Instead, I overcame this by creating a function that accepts an EditText object and directly parses it into a double or int and stores it in a single variable. This cuts out the middleman string variable. This also touches on the ideas of 3 of the critical principles of object oriented programming: encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity. Of note as well is that I learned about how spinners work in AndroidStudio and used them to create dropdown lists with values stored in arrays. I was not familiar with what a spinner was before beginning this enhancement. It's a small detail, but it's the combination of these little, tiny things that you learn along the way that create a solid foundation to build even more knowledge on top of.</p>
		<h3>Enhancement 3</h3>
		<p>This enhancement definitely demonstrates skill in working with Databases (SQLite in particular) as was a requirement of this assignment. It involved heavy work on the DatabaseHelper file which was used to accomplish the goals I set out to achieve when starting this assignment. I took the existing database and made a few additions to one of the database tables so that these fields could be edited as well as read and incorporated into the function of the weight loss calculator. I discussed this in the corresponding section in more detail above, but this enhancement involved adding additional items to the database for the user's preferred name, their height, and their gender. A user profile page was created to make this possible from the user perspective. Once these were added, the relevant values were pulled from the database and used to prepopulate fields in the weight loss calculator so that the user doesn't need to manually enter them.</p>
		<p>This project further reinforced my understanding of managing data that is traveling back and forth across different activities and using the appropriate key to extract the appropriate data. It was also a minor challenge for me as well. Juggling multiple new buttons, I ran into the problem that I wasn’t passing the user ID between activities which is necessary in order to locate the relevant data in the database that is tied to that user ID. And as was the case with the last two milestones, I continued to learn how useful it is to break a problem down into tiny modularized pieces in order solve it step by step rather than all at once and risk breaking something in the code. I harp on this specific point a lot, but it's one of the most important and foundational concepts in any kind of programming. The ability to break a problem into small pieces and solve them individually to yield a finished product after putting it all together is arguably the most critical thing of all for a programmer to learn. It's a skill that isn't fully refined after doing it once, it's a skill that one becomes better and better at with every single problem they solve, and it's a skill that I along with all programmers will further refine throughout our careers.</p>
