		<h2>The Original Application</h2>
		<p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/TheDakDakDak/DakotaBrownCapstone/tree/main/Pre-Enhancement%20App" target="_blank">pre-enhanced code files</a> on GitHub.</p>
		<p>This original Android Studio project was created in the beginning of 2024 for a class that I took at Southern New Hampshire University called "Mobile Architecture and Programming".</p>
		<p>This app is a simple weight tracker which allows the user to create an account and log in. After logging in, they're brought to the main page where they can add weights to their list which are saved and displayed on the main grid. The user may also set a goal weight which is stored in a database and they are notified via SMS once they reach their goal weight. The notification functionality however was non-functional for this project.</p>
		<p>The source code consists of java and their corresponding xml layout files for the login page, create account page, and the main grid page where their list of weights by date are displayed. It also contains a databasehelper file which uses SQLite to store their login information as well as the weights they've entered and their goal weight. As this was created in an intro class designed for students with no prior experience in mobile programming, it is extremely simple and contains no advanced features. This code was improved upon for my capstone project in July and August of 2024, and you can read more about the improved version <a href="../enhancements/enhancements.html">here</a>.</p>
